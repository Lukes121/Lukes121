<h1>Goals:</h1>

- Hosting for public and private repositories to provide a measure of parity for my projects

- Showcase some of the ideas I cared enough about to either make a passion project out of, or tools I didn't want to have to make a second time

- Create a Public resource for myself and others to get these tools from

<h2>Technologies:</h2>

C# - This is the development language I have spent the most time in, and indeed the most readable of the languages. 

Powershell - A friend of sysadmins, and a pain point for those used to strongly typed environments. 

Python - The do it all toolkit. The private projects are really cool, maybe you'll touch them some day.

BASH - Sometimes you need it. What else is there to say.
